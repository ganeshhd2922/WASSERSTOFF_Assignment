About project: In this assignment, I used React JS to create a bar chart, bubble chart dashboard, Navbar sidebar and world map. The world map was used in the project home section to display data visually. In addition, I designed faster components which were used to show total earning and fetch information using API data. My approach towards the task was systematic and comprehensive; ensuring that all aspects of it were taken into consideration for successful completion of the assignment.
